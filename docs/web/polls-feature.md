Polls feature allows you to create polls and let users vote on them. You can create polls for anything you want. Eg: You can create polls to ask users about their favorite game, favorite food, etc.

Only authenticated users can vote on polls. Users can only vote once on a poll. User cannot change their vote once they have voted on a poll.

:::note Polls can't be edited
Polls can only be create and deleted. There is no edit button for polls. If you created a poll and have some mistake in it, you can delete it and create a new one.

This is not a bug. This is a feature.
