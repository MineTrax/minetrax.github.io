:::note Why there are two variables - Rating & Score?
Idea of having separate rating & score is to have some varity in ranking players. Score is something we consider to be always increasing as player continue to play in your server with time, while Rating is something that can go up or down depending on player performance kind of like ELO rating system. 

In MineTrax by default we use score to calculate player rank, while we use rating to calculate player position in leaderboards.

This system give new players with better skill a chance to be in leaderboard position sooner, while satisfying long time players to always have higher rank.
