You can update your Web using either Automatic or Manual method.

## Automatic Upgrading Web

Using this mode all you have to do is take latest pull and run a script.

```
git pull origin main
bash update.sh
```

Note: It should automatically update everything for you. If it fails you will have to manually handle update using below manual method.

## Manually Upgrading Web

:::caution
Upgrade guide for web consider `Ubuntu` as operating system. If you using some other OS you might have to tweak some commands accordingly.
:::

Follow the process step by step to upgrade web to latest version.

### 1. Enter Maintenance Mode

Maintenance mode will disable the web for end user so we don't expose any unexpected error or logs to them.

```
cd /var/www/minetrax

php artisan down
```

### 2. Clear compiled template & cache

```
cd /var/www/minetrax

php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan clear
```

### 3. Take the latest pull

Take latest pull from the Github web repo.

```
cd /var/www/minetrax

git pull origin main
```

:::caution
If you have made any changes to the code, this process might fail and you have to revert back your changes before taking the pull. If the process fail then stash out your local changes and try to pull again. Make sure to backup your changes so you can add them back.

```
cd /var/www/minetrax

git stash
git pull origin main
```

:::

### 4. Fix Permissions

Once latest changes are pulled fix back the permissions for files.

<Tabs groupId="apache-nginx">
  <TabItem value="apache" label="Apache2">

```bash
# If using NGINX or Apache (not on CentOS):
chown -R $USER:www-data /var/www/minetrax/*

# or, If using Apache on CentOS
chown -R $USER:apache /var/www/minetrax/*
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nginx" label="Nginx">

```bash
# If using NGINX or Apache (not on CentOS):
chown -R $USER:www-data /var/www/minetrax/*

# or, If using NGINX on CentOS:
chown -R $USER:nginx /var/www/minetrax/*
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Change permission for `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` folders

```bash
cd /var/www/minetrax
chmod -R 775 storage/* bootstrap/cache
```

:::caution
In some rare cases if you are getting error like `The stream or file "/var/www/minetrax/storage/logs/laravel.log" could not be opened: failed to open stream: Permission denied` then you might have to change the permission of `storage/logs` folder to `777` instead of `775`.

```bash
cd /var/www/minetrax
chmod -R 777 storage/* bootstrap/cache
```

:::

### 4. Update the composer

Install the latest dependencies changes from composer

```
cd /var/www/minetrax

composer install
```

### 5. Run the migrations

```
cd /var/www/minetrax

php artisan migrate --force --seed
```

### 6. Restart the Queue Listeners

```
cd /var/www/minetrax

php artisan queue:restart
```

### 7. Fix Permissions

```
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/minetrax/*
```

### 8. Exit the Maintenance Mode

Everything is done! Now lets turn back the site up for everyone.
