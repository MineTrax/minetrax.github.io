:::

## Server Requirements

:::note
The installation steps given in this docs consider you using debian based OS eg: `Ubuntu 20.04`. If your server is running any other OS then you might have to do slight adjustments as per need during the process. Feel free to contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Hzfj27k) for any help.
:::
MineTrax is designed to run on your web server of choice. It is recommended to use a VPS or Dedicated Server as hosting and not any shared hosting.

Web requires a VPS or Dedicated Server with atleast 1GB of RAM and 1 CPU. Ubuntu 20.04 is recommended.

Software Dependencies:

- PHP 8.1+
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.2.7+
- Apache2 or Nginx
- NodeJS 12+
- Redis Server
- Git
- Composer
- Supervisor
- Sendmail

:::tip
It is recommended to start with a fresh server to follow along. A small Virtual Server with 1 vCPU should be fine to start with.
Cloud providers like [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/aece040492d0) & [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=UBpE7ZNeerEj) give credit upto 100$ to get started for free.
:::

## Installing Dependencies

Update operating system to make sure all existing packages are up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### PHP

First, install the prerequisites and PPA and update.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php -y
sudo apt update
```

Install PHP 8.1 and all required extensions.

```bash
sudo apt -y install curl php8.2 php8.2-{cli,gd,mysql,pdo,mbstring,tokenizer,bcmath,xml,fpm,curl,zip,intl,redis}
```

### MySQL / MariaDB

:::caution
Make sure to only install one. Either MySQL or MariaDB. If installing MariaDB, make sure its version is >10.2.7.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mysql" label="MySQL">

```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Apache2 / Nginx

:::caution
Make sure to only install one. Either Nginx or Apache2.
:::

<Tabs groupId="apache-nginx">
  <TabItem value="apache" label="Apache2">
Install Apache2 server and php extension for it.

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php8.1
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nginx" label="Nginx">
Install Nginx server and php-fpm runner.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx php8.1-fpm
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Composer

Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.
You'll need composer installed before continuing in this process.

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

### NodeJS

Add the Node PPA and update (here we are installing version 16, you can change if you want).

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x -o /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
```

Install NodeJS from APT

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

### Redis Server, Git, Sendmail & Supervisor

```bash
sudo apt install redis-server git supervisor sendmail unzip
sudo systemctl enable --now redis-server
```

## Installation

### Cloning the codes from Github

Create a folder where the web will live and move to that folder.

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/minetrax
cd /var/www/minetrax
```

Now clone the MineTrax git repo to the newly created folder and fix permissions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MineTrax/minetrax.git .
sudo chmod -R 775 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

### Setup the Database

You need to create a MySQL/MariaDB database and a user with all permission to that database.

```sql
// If below command ask for password just press enter. If not work then try sudo mysql
mysql -u root -p

// Create the database
CREATE DATABASE minetrax;
// Create the user, change 'randomStrongPassword' to any strong password of your choice.
CREATE USER 'minetrax'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'randomStrongPassword';
// Give permission of the DB to user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON minetrax.* TO 'minetrax'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
exit
```

### Environment and Migration

Now that the database is up we need to go back to the minetrax folder and copy `.env.example` file to `.env`.

```bash
cd /var/www/minetrax
cp .env.example .env
```

Install the composer dependencies.

```bash
composer install
```

Now generate a new key using.

```bash
# Only run the if you are doing fresh install and don't have data in the database.
php artisan key:generate --force
```

Next, change the database related variables in the `.env` file to match your database user credentials

```bash title=.env
APP_URL=http://your_domain.com # Change this to the URL which you wanna setup minetrax on.

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=minetrax
DB_USERNAME=minetrax
DB_PASSWORD=randomStrongPassword
```

Migration and Seed the database, run the below command in terminal:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Create symlink for storage

```
php artisan storage:link
```

:::danger IMPORTANT
It is highly recommended to copy `.env` file and backup it somewhere safe. It contain very important information like `APP_KEY` which is used to encrypt critical data before storing in database (eg: api keys and server credentials).
Without that key recovering data won't be possible.

Also, always keep that key secret.
:::


### Fix permissions

Fix permissions for the web folder so webserver can access the files.

<Tabs groupId="apache-nginx">
  <TabItem value="apache" label="Apache2">

```bash
# If using Apache (not on CentOS):
chown -R $USER:www-data /var/www/minetrax/*

# or, If using Apache on CentOS
chown -R $USER:apache /var/www/minetrax/*
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nginx" label="Nginx">

```bash
# If using NGINX (not on CentOS):
chown -R $USER:www-data /var/www/minetrax/*

# or, If using NGINX on CentOS:
chown -R $USER:nginx /var/www/minetrax/*
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Setup Queue Listeners

Queue are used to run long running task like sending email, clearing stale data and importing data from servers. Queue workers in need to setup for these tasks to run.

#### Add the cron

Firstly, need to add the scheduler runner command to cron.
Open crontab `sudo crontab -e` and add then following in a new line there.

```
* * * * * php /var/www/minetrax/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

#### Create queue worker:

We use supervisor for running of queue worker so incase they crash supervisor will automatically restart them.

Configuration file for supervisor are stored in folder `/etc/supervisor/conf.d`. All supervisor conf file we create will be in there.

#### Default queue:

Create a new file called `minetrax-worker-default.conf` and put below context in there.

```bash title=/etc/supervisor/conf.d/minetrax-worker-default.conf
[program:minetrax-worker-default]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /var/www/minetrax/artisan queue:work --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
user=www-data
numprocs=2
redirect_stderr=true
stopwaitsecs=3660
```

#### Long queue:

Create a new file called `minetrax-worker-long.conf` and put below context in there.

```bash title=/etc/supervisor/conf.d/minetrax-worker-long.conf
[program:minetrax-worker-long]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /var/www/minetrax/artisan queue:work --queue=longtask,default redis-longtask --timeout=0 --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-jobs=500
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
user=www-data
numprocs=2
redirect_stderr=true
stopwaitsecs=3660
```

#### Start the supervisor workers:

```
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update

sudo supervisorctl start minetrax-worker-default:*
sudo supervisorctl start minetrax-worker-long:*
```

:::info Restart the queue
Whenever any change is made to code, queue worker don't pick them up as they are long running. To make laravel queue restart we run:

```
php artisan queue:restart
```

:::

### WebSocket setup (optional)

:::info Recommendation
This step is optional but highly recommended. By default minetrax will use polling to fetch and reload data from server without reloading. (eg: every 5 seconds).

If you want your site to feel more responsive and instant or you have a large audience and want to reduce the load on your server then you should setup websocket.
:::

In this step we are going to setup [Pusher](https://pusher.com) as our websocket server.

1. Go to [pusher.com](https://pusher.com) and create a account.
2. In dashboard select "Channels" and then click "Create app" option to create a new app.
3. Name your app anything you like and choose a location closest to your server location. Choose `Vue.js` in Frontend and `Laravel` in Backend dropdowns.
4. Click `Create App`.
5. Now go to `App Keys` section and note down the `app_id`, `key`, `secret` and `cluster` variables.
   Eg:

```js
app_id = "1367909";
key = "4b48b850682acb371c34";
secret = "41cc8be68c0d57fea4f3";
cluster = "ap2";
```

After this open your `.env` file and replace the pusher related credentials to match above.

```bash title=.env
PUSHER_APP_ID=1367909
PUSHER_APP_KEY=4b48b850682acb371c34
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=41cc8be68c0d57fea4f3
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=ap2
```

Also change broadcast driver to pusher.

```bash title=.env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
```

Next, restart the queue workers:

```
cd /var/www/minetrax
php artisan queue:restart
```

:::tip pusher alternatives
Pusher provide 200k messages per day in free tier, which is more than enough for most cases, but if you have a very large userbase that might not be enough. In that case please check **[Websocket Options](./websocket-options.md)** page to learn how to setup Pusher alternatives.

_It is recommended to go for alternatives only after giving Pusher a try and its limit runs out._
:::

### Web Server Configuration

Finally lets setup the web server to access the web.
Make sure your domain name is pointing to the IP address of the VPS/Dedicated server in which we are setting up the web. To do that you need to create an A record for your domain to the webserver IP from your domain DNS Provider.

:::caution
Follow either Nginx or Apache2 steps as per your installation.
:::

<Tabs groupId="apache-nginx">
  <TabItem value="apache" label="Apache2">
<b>Apache2 Setup</b>

First, Create a new file with any name(eg: `minetrax.conf`) in the Apache2 sites directory `/etc/apache2/sites-available` with context provided below replacing highlighted section as per your installation.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/minetrax.conf
```

```text title=/etc/apache2/sites-available/minetrax.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
  // highlight-next-line
  ServerName your_domain.com
  // highlight-next-line
  ServerAlias www.your_domain.com
  DocumentRoot "/var/www/minetrax/public"

  AllowEncodedSlashes On

  <Directory "/var/www/minetrax/public">
    AllowOverride all
    Require all granted
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Next, enable rewrite mod & the site, and finally restart apache2 to reflect the changes.

```
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2ensite minetrax.conf

sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

:::caution
You should disable default site `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`.

```bash
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nginx" label="Nginx">
<b>Nginx Setup</b>

First, Create a new file with any name(eg: `minetrax.conf`) in the Nginx sites directory `/etc/nginx/sites-available` with context provided below replacing highlighted section as per your installation.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/minetrax.conf
```

```text title=/etc/nginx/sites-available/minetrax.conf
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    // highlight-next-line
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;
    root /var/www/minetrax/public;

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    index index.php;

    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

    error_page 404 /index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

Now create a symlink of the file created to `sites-enabled` folder.

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/minetrax.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

and finally reload your Nginx server to reflect the changes.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

:::caution
If this is a new VPS, you should disable default site `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` by removing it.

```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Finalize

Now minetrax should be up and running on your domain `http://your_domain.com`.

A SuperAdmin user is created already for you, you can login and change the password:

```
Username: superadmin
Password: admin123
```

:::danger CHANGE PASSWORD & EMAIL
It is very important that you change the **password** & **email** of the `superadmin` user after logging in.

*You can change password from `Edit Profile` section and email from `Admin > Users` section*
:::


After checking your site is up and running, make sure to change `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false` in the `.env` file.

```bash title=.env
APP_NAME="YOUR_DESIRED_APP_NAME"
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
```

:::danger DISABLE DEBUG MODE
It is very important that you change your **APP_ENV** to `production` and **APP_DEBUG** to `false` in the `.env` file when you are done testing and setting up the site.

**Keeping APP_ENV to `local` or APP_DEBUG to `true` might expose sensitive information to end users.**
:::

### What's Next?

Now you are all set to go, you can start using minetrax and add your servers to it.
