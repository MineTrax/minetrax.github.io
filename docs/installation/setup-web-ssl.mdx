Currently your website should be running on `http://YOUR_DOMAIN` which is not secure.
In this section we will enable HTTPS on the web with help of [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) so you can access your site like `https://YOUR_DOMAIN`.

:::tip
1. If you are using CloudFlare as your DNS Provider. You can use it's free SSL feature by enabling it from their dashboard and ignore this section.
Read more about it [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/).

2. If you are using MineTrax with Docker, **Don't** follow this section.

### Certbot Installation & Issue Certificate

Follow the install and certificate issue process for your webserver either Apache2 or Nginx.

<Tabs groupId="apache-nginx">
  <TabItem value="apache" label="Apache2">

Install Certbot and it's Apache2 plugin with apt.

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache
```

Find what domain you have setup in your apache2 config file for minetrax `minetrax.conf`. In our case it was `your_domain.com` and `www.your_domain.com`.

Run the certbot to issue certificates for these domains. Make sure to replace `your_domain.com` with your own domain.

```
sudo certbot --apache -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com
```

Finally incase it ask you if you want to Redirect all your traffic to https. Select the option to redirect (option 2 in most cases).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nginx" label="Nginx">

Install Certbot and it's Nginx plugin with apt.

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Find what domain you have setup in your nginx config file for minetrax `minetrax.conf`. In our case it was `your_domain.com` and `www.your_domain.com`.

Run the certbot to issue certificates for these domains. Make sure to replace `your_domain.com` with your own domain.

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com
```

Finally incase it ask you if you want to Redirect all your traffic to https. Select the option to redirect (option 2 in most cases).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you should be able to access your website with `https://YOUR_DOMAIN`.

### Update .env to use HTTPS

Now that we have HTTPS enabled on the website. We need to update our `.env` file to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

Open the `.env` file in your favorite editor and update the `APP_URL` from `http://YOUR_DOMAIN` to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN`.

```bash
cd /var/www/minetrax
nano .env
```

```bash
APP_URL=https://YOUR_DOMAIN
```

Save the file and that's it.


### Verify Certbot Auto-Renewal

LetsEncrypt certificates are valid only for 3 months. 
The certbot package we installed takes care of this for us by adding a systemd timer that will run twice a day and automatically renew any certificate that's within thirty days of expiration.

Check the status of the timer.
```bash
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

To check if auto renew will succeed.

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```
If you see no errors, you're all set.
